Hi, I am Calvin (Hao Chen), majored Automatic Control at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/cn/), 
accidentally growing into a Computer Vision researcher. 
My current interests range from statistical theory of Deep Learning and low-light image enhancement to 
fault detection algorithm in the tech industry. 

I'm currently working on the [ASML](http://asml.com/) and pursuing my master degree of computer science at [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). 

I was also instereted and involved in some of the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/calvchen) competitions. 

I generally appear in University of Birmingham Library, spending my time on math, data science, psychology, game theory or finance. If you also love spending time in Lobrary, I believe we will have a good time! 

Welcome to my Blog.
