It's important to note that **you** will be the driver in  your mentoring relationship. This means it is your responsibility to  arrange meetings, determine discussion topics and keep in contact with  your mentor in order to get the most from the relationship. Mentors  offer a minimum of one hour a month and utilising both of yours and  their time effectively will help with the progression of the  relationship.

## Preparing

- Think about what you want to achieve and come prepared to your first meeting and all subsequent meetings. 
- Establish SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound) objectives and create a mentoring action plan.

## Building rapport

- Take time to draft your first email to ensure you make a great first impression.
- Establish boundaries around how and when you will communicate.
- Get to know each other – see what common interests you share.
- Keep on track with  your emails and respond to your mentor, but please be understanding that they are very busy and will get back to you as soon as they can. Due to busy work schedules it is likely this can take at least 1 or 2 weeks. 

## Ongoing meetings

- Set agendas and ask insightful questions.
- Monitor your progress - try to ensure you are achieving what you set out to do and effectively using your mentor's time. 
- Give feedback throughout the process – let your mentor know whether  the sessions are proving useful to you. If you think the sessions could  be improved, put forward your suggestions.
- Review your meetings to consider what you have learnt.

## Moving forward

- Towards the end of the scheme you should start to think about arranging a final meeting to evaluate the relationship.
- Be sure to thank your mentor for giving up their time.
- Share what you have learned with your mentor and the outcomes of the relationship. For example has this led to great confidence in your  ability or increased knowledge of your chosen section?
- Once the formal mentoring period is over, think about the impact mentoring has had on you and what your next steps are.

### **Mentoring is a two-way process, your mentor will:**

- Develop their professional skills, such as active listening and communication
- Connect or re-connect with the university
- Gain a new perspective and have the chance to reflect on their experiences
- Feel valued and appreciated by their mentee
- Meet the future graduate talent - YOU!
