ML benefit of the planet, from space?

Agricultural application



### Data

satellite data: different from the normal RGB image

12-200 different spatial resolution ( multi-band image )

7k*5k resolution...

combine all this band? 

#### U-net

Why we can't throw every thing into the model?

memory that filled up very quickly, memory consumption



Not whole image input is a good idea.



Why the model is confused about the road and the field?

Binary target don't always have road label...

Better Label data?

The size of the input - sufficient info and the memory consumption

### Right 

DICE: 

MAX Filters on the lower block: 1024 or 2048 is helpful

Unet 48x1024x4: ISxNxMF

Not good for small structure..

### LSTM

consecutive

Satellite takes image at different time..

Some distortion of weather condition

moisture sensor data.... avoid human labour

1 value/ hour/ sensor

but the sensor is noisy.. cannot be true

also use rainfall data etc.

unify the data... 

sentinel ?

What is the difficulty of LSTM?

Multi-type of data input.. A little long to compute, cannot be real-time..

soil moisture of the ground in the next 2 weeks, preserve water

the landscape is kind of different... farmland



imagery.. avoid heavy model





What is the band of the image?

light spectrum?





# PhD studentship

biomedical area.. 4-year

What is the project about

CMR 

Seg and Registration using CMR data

real access to the hospital data

Dynamic Images

motional track.... more normal in clinical setting

heart..
