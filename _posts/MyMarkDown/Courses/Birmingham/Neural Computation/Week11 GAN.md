# GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks

KL?

Give a sample( gaussian ) -> Generator -> Image

How to make generated Image similar to the target Image



Discriminator take them in and out put as binary classifier: real or fake?

$D$ with sigmoid on top (Probability)?

$\phi'=argmax E_{x\to p_{data}}[logD_\phi]+E_{x\to p(x)}[log(1-D_\phi(G_\phi(x)))]$

Min-Max Game Theory



Losses for G in practical is $-log(D(G(z)))$
