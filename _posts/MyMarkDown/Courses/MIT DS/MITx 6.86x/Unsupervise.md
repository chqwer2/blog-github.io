# Unsupervised Learning

we use a lot of type of unsupervised learning.

For instance, if you are looking at stories

that you read everyday at Google News,

you would see that a machine can automatically

cluster different stories written about the same event.



##### Cost

and sometimes there are many possible ways

to assign the grouping to our points.

So in order to determine which ones are good

and which ones are bad, we really

need to know, what is the cost of the clustering?





##### Image Quantization

Obviously we lose most of the details.

We can still recognize the characters.

We will get great compression rate

but will clearly negatively impact

the quality of the picture.
