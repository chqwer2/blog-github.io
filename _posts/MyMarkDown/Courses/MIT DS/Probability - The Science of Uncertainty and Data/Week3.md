So we're counting zero-element subsets, one-element subsets,

all the way up to n.

So what we're counting really is the number of all subsets

of our given set.

But this is a number that we know what it is.

The number of subsets of a given set with n

elements is 2 to the n.

So by thinking carefully and interpreting the terms in this

sum, we were able to solve this problem very fast,

something that would be extremely tedious if we had

tried to do it algebraically.

### Binomial probabilities

Sequence, which slots contain heads

chose k slots out of n slots : n-choose-k

The reason that this approach worked was that the

conditional universe, the event B, had a uniform

probability law on it.

You've learned about permutations, you've learned

about k-permutations, you've learned about combinations,

and you've learned about partitions.
