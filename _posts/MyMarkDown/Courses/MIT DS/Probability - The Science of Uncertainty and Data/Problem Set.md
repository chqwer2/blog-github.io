##### Problem 1. Parking lot problem

Mary and Tom park their cars in an empty parking lot with  consecutive parking spaces (i.e,  spaces in a row, where only one car fits in each space). Mary and Tom  pick parking spaces at random; of course, they must each choose a  different space. (All pairs of distinct parking spaces are equally  likely.) What is the probability that there is at most one empty parking space between them?
