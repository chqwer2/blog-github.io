# Hyperbolic functions

They are analogues of the ordinary trigonometric functions, but defined using the **hyperbola** rather than the **circle**.

### What is hyperbola? (双曲线)

Is a kind of a geometric curve.

A double cone consists of two cones stacked point-to-point and sharing the same axis of rotation; it may be generated by rotating a line about an axis that passes through a point of the line." style="zoom:10%;" />

The hyperbola is **one of the three kinds** of [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section), formed by the intersection of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics)) and a double [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)).  (The other conic sections are the [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola) and the [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse). 



### Hyperbolic functions

**Sinh & Cosh**

 Just as the points (cos *t*, sin *t*) form a **circle with a unit radius**, the points (**cosh *t*, sinh *t***) form the **right half of the unit hyperbola**. 

Also, just as the derivatives of sin(*t*) and cos(*t*) are cos(*t*) and –sin(*t*), the derivatives of sinh(*t*) and cosh(*t*) are cosh(*t*) and +sinh(*t*).



The hyperbolic functions take a [real argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) called a [hyperbolic angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_angle). The size of a hyperbolic angle is twice the area of its [hyperbolic sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_sector). The hyperbolic functions may be defined in terms of the [legs of a right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_sector#Hyperbolic_triangle) covering this sector.
