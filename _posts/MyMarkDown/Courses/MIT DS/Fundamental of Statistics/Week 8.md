it would be nicer

if we had a complete, generic way of building

a test from an estimator without having to go through confidence

intervals.



1. So it's a simple approach, and it was actually
2. quite convenient.
3. We first built a confidence interval.
4. And then we deduce a test, which is nice.

behind the wald test, an alternative is the T test

### Wald Test 

based on asymptotic test.

But what if the sample size is too small that we re not in the range of applications of thos asymptotic results, such as CLT.

Then we have to be careful to use some called T-test.



The key of Wald Test is to build a estimator that have asymptotic statement, and the var is only data dependent.

Wald test is based on how close our estimator is.

Reject the indicator:

is a estimator of variance…

Assume that our data is generated by null but rejected:

##### Example

The status quo should be that, at most, 2/3 of Americans

get their news from social media.

And we're going to try to bring evidence

that, in fact, this number is larger than 2/3.

Our estimator is larger than 2/3, but the question is, do we have enough sample

to conclude that this p hat being larger than 2/3

is actually because the true population is larger than 2/3?

Or is this just due to random fluctuations?

W = 1.93 > $q_5$ = 1.645

but I want to torch exactly 1.93, thus $\alpha$=2.68%

**p-values of Wald test.**

And I'm always looking at the probability

that I reject even more than what I observe.

I reject even more than what I observe, OK?



We have p value now, but we don’t know the distribution of **W**.

But, asymptotically, I can compute the p-value. This converge to the standard Gaussian exceeds this observed value.

The variance it's a bit more complicated

than just the variance of an average

because it's the variance of the difference between two averages.

What does it mean?

Both asymptotic and non-asymptotic

instead of looking at the different of theta, we can also look at the $lg L$

1. And so instead of actually maximizing
2. the likelihood over all possible thetas,
3. I'm going to try to maximize the likelihood over thetas
4. that agree with theta 0.

1. OK, so this is essentially how you could do your sanity check.?
