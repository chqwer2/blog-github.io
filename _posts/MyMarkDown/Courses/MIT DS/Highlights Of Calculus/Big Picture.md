Parabola

# Big Picture of Calculus

It is related to two functions:

Function (1) = Distance — $f(t)$ or $y(x)$

Function (2) = Speed — $S=\frac{df}{dt}$ or $S=\frac{dy}{dx}$

Or Height/ Slope

# Max and Min and Second Derivative

Second derivative tells me bending of the graph

Acceleration $\frac{d^2f}{dt^2}$

# The Exponential Function

The derivative equal to itself:

e^x = y(x)=\frac{dy}{dx}

second important infinite theory 
$$
e^x=1+x+\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{6}x^3+\cdots
$$
The most important infinite theory (Geometric Theory, succeed when $x<1$)
$$
1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots
$$
e is called Euler’s number $\approx 2.7818$

**Bank Compounding Interest**: 102% every year

calculus said cut the step down, every year to every day? How about separated into more?

To much, it will no more than $e$
$$
e = (1+\frac{1}{N})^N
$$
