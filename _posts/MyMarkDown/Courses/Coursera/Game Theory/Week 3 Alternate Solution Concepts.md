### 3-1 Beyond the Nash Equilibrium 

**Dominated Strategies **(DS)

Bruce and Grace jumping out a plane:

Why Grace truth Bruce will packing the parachute safely?

DS - Not packing appropriately is bad also from himself.

So Grace only chose to care the reminder of the game.

**Zero-sum games**

Doing as well for yourself = hurting other player = Being Nash Equilibrium

### 3-2 Strictly Dominated Strategies & Iterative Removal 

**Rationality**:

players maximize their payoffs

The chain of knows

**Strictly Dominated Strategies**

Can never be a best reply, Let us remove it as it will not be played.

Prerequisite: players are rational

Now we have simpler (reduced) game, then we do the **same thing**.

Remove Sequence: **C > R**, git rid of R, then **U> M**, then **C>L**, then **D>U**

Find the unique Nash Equilibrium

Another example:

This case M is dominated by **mixture strategy** playing 1/2 U and 1/2 D and so forth

### 3-3 Dominated Strategies & Iterative Removal: An Application 

Feeding the larger and smaller pigs

The Small will wait, the large will do the lever thing

### 3-4 Maxmin and Minmax Strategies 

![image-20211127201217041](https://chqwer2.github.io/img/Typora/image-20211127201217041.png)

提下界, 降上界

Maximize the worse-case payoff of $i$

Why the player $i$ wants to hurt the other guy?

Cannot move out from the saddle points cuz it will benefit the other people

**Compute Minmax**
