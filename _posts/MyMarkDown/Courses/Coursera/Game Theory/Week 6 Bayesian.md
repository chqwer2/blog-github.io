# Bayesian Game

Tea Auction: Unclear about the value

Silent Auction

Bayesian is used to model this kind of uncertainty.

### 6-2 Bayesian Games: First Definition 

**Before**: know a lot o information belows...

Know what they doing...

Imperfect information game: You don't know others' play, but know the payoff of each possible action

conditioning a common prior on individual private signals.

Why players are deciding what action is being take, they have to play an action without fully knowing what game is.

And they have to reason about what they opponent is doing without fully knowing what the opponent is going to play



### 6-3 Bayesian Games: Second Definition

The introduction of **Type**

### 6-4 Analyzing Bayesian Games 

**Bayesian Equilibrium**

1. expecting over the actions of other players
2. expecting over the types of other players

BE is a plan of action for each player as a function of types that maximize each type's expected utility.

Three standard notions of expected utility:

	1. ex-ante  事前
	- the agent know nothing about anyone's actual type
	2. interim  过渡期
	- an agent knows her own type but no the types of others'
	3. ex-post  
	- the agent knows all the types

### Interim expected utility

Given a Bayesian game, $i$'s IEU with respect to type $\theta_i$ and a mixed strategy profile $s$ is ..

Look to Some Auctions Later..



**A sheriff's Dilemma**

Shoot or not?

- the suspect is either a criminal with probability $p$. 
- the sheriff would rather shoot if the suspect shoots, but not if the suspect does not.
- the criminal would rather shoot even if thesheriff does not, as the criminal would be caught if does not shoot.
- the innocent suspect would rather not shoot even if the sheriff shoots.

Two different types of players: the Suspects and Innocents

**What is going to happened?**

For Innocents, the strictly dominant startegy is Not shoot

Criminal tends to shoot

If p>1/3, sheriff shoots

That is how to deal with uncertainty.
