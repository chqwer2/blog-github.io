Financialization of Housing, in my opinion, is an unethical movement. It may appear that I am overreacting; nonetheless, I hold such attitude toward it since it not only deviates from the basic goal of housing, but also jeopardizes people's living welfare. As Leilani Farha said in her statement, housing has now been financialized and treated as a commodity rather than a human dwelling. 

Buying real estate is now more like a means to secure and accumulate wealth by excessive capital than seeking for place to live in dignity. Such as Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs), which is designed as a financial instruments to invest collectively in the real estate industry, is intended to trade houses like a stock to profit from housing price increased. This transition has already caused severe social contradictions In differentiation's process of this economic interest across different social stratums. 

For example, according to CEIC Data, Hong Kong housing prices have risen more than threefold within recent 10 years, comparatively, the Per capita GDP in Hong Kong only increased by 142.31%. Hong Kong government reported the vacancy rate of private homes at the end of 2020 has reached 4.3% of total storage. However, young people could hardly ever afford the house prices, most residents are forced to live in miniscule house or even rendered homeless to give their way to luxury houses. 

Moreover, real estate developers deliberately slow down the development speed of commercial real estate , which can last for more than 10 years compared to normally 3-year development lifecycle, for chasing higher profits, which furtherly enlarge the demand gap and keep the housing price plummeting crazily. Similar situations also happened around the world, including United Kingdom, United States of America and China mainland. 

As a university student, I can clearly feel the latest depression about settling down in metropolitans throughout young people because of the unaffordable housing prices of the financialized housing markets. 

Youngsters hope to find a high salary work and buy their own house to get rooted in the big city. However, the house where can give them home, will cost them decades of payment of work. The excessively high prices have hindered the young blood from going to the big cities to fight for their dream. What's more, the profits from price Increment mostly concentrated in the upper class or huge capital that undermines the possibilities of class transition eventually make young people can't see the end. 

What can we do now to ease these situations?

To cope with the Financialization of Housing, China has passed housing restriction policy in 2010 to limit the amount of real estates everyone can possess and furtherly imposed Realty Transfer Fee to prevent people from getting profit by frequent transaction of houses. As mentioned by Leilani Farha, a number of States have instituted some restrictions on foreign purchasers of residential real estate.

Putting heavy taxes on vacant homes and houses beyond the need can be an efficient method to restraint Housing Financialization. This additional taxes on luxury properties can be applied with revenues used  to subsidize rent of graduated student and low-income households.

With all we mentioned above may not be enough to address the housing shortage and high housing prices problems, but it is key to stop Financialization of Housing, stop the prices plummet trend. Financializing housing markets is not related the free market theory that someone may refer to let the market taking the wheel to guide the price according the demand and supply, on the opposite, it should be strictly limited to maximum the supplication for the needed. As far as from where I stand, Financialization of Housing is the way that getting personal benefits from the appreciation of land value brought by the economic development of all the society, which means average all the financial risks and costs to every one in order to earn personal interests.

Thus, I agree what Leilani Farha said, States should take action to limit the Financialization of Housing.
