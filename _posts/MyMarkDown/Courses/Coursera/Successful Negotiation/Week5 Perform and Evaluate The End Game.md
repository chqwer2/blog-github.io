**Mini Trial:**

Two attorney and CEO settle the dispute in a given time

Why? The court is zero-sum game. SO mini trial can preserve the business relationship

**Rent A Judge:** hire a retired judge to hear the case

Saving money and time, keep the dispute private

**Baseball Arbitration** : Rather have the arbitrator select the salary, each side submit a number to the arbitrator. The arbitrator has to pick one.

### ADR Tools

Transformative: for transform the relationship between parties

With facilitative, the goal of the mediator was to facilitate conversation,  discussion, and negotiation between the two sides to reach a settlement.  With evaluative mediation, the mediator would do the same thing except also would be asked to **give an evaluation** of the mediation to provide certain expertise. 

Use of a caucus: The **mediator** can ask the reservation price for each side privately and do a analysis to construct a zone of potential agreement

**active listening** ang suggest options, reality testing

When one of the parties talked about going to court, we've got a great case, we're just, we're just going to sue. And she used active listening and said yes, you know, I understand what you're saying. You could go to court you ave perhaps a good case but think of what that's going to cost you and think about whether that will solve your problem, which is getting your ro, robotics software. In effect the other side's problem is also your problem, why don't we work on solving that problem rather than going to court. So very good on reality testing. 

### Contract Performance Review and Evaluation

Why has a Re-negotiation?
