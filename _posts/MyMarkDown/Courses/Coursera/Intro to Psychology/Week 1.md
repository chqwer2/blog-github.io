## The Brain

### The astonishing hypothesis

Brain is associated to who and how we are.

And the story of Phineas Gage (accidentally had a iron bar through his brain) illustrates something which we have abundant reason to believe, which is that the brain is the source of mental life. 

**Materialism**: Brain = Mind

**唯物主义**

The official term for this is materialism that we are material beings. 

Everybody accepts that our arms and legs and our heart and 

kidneys are made of the same sort of stuff as rabbits and automobiles and cups. 

But the idea is that our mental life, what makes us special, 

our most intimate feelings and thoughts also arise from these material things. 

And this the idea that makes possible the discipline of neuroscience and 

much of psychology. 

**Dualism**

**二元论**

Descartes thought human are composed in part of material, and some parts spiritual that doesn't reduce to the material.

- Cuz human aren’t like animal or robots (in 17th Century), which behave in **simple** ways responding to the env.

- His claim was we don't feel like bodies. What can we question, what do we know for sure?  You could be wrong that there's a physical world around you (From observation from mental illness people). It's best articulated in the movie, The Matrix, which maintains that we think we're running around in the physical world, but actually, 

  with the lucky exception of our heroes like Neo and Trinity, 

  we're actually just plugged into some sort of system. 



But Descartes said, "There's one thing you can't doubt. 

You can't doubt your own consciousness. 

You can't doubt your own existence." 

The famous line is, 

"I think, therefore I am." 

So you can doubt you have a body, but you can’t doubt you have a mind.



**But** dualism is also emerged out of common sense. My mind is the same age as my body.

We found that we can understand body swamp or body switching in the movie, showing at least we accept that least of the possibility, that you can hop from one body to another. 

Our conception that bodies and cells are separate, allows us to accept idea you had many people inhabiting one body. Separable.

Religious Dualism: Plainly you got bodies without mind (corpus), and also minds without bodies (spirit).

If asked people no matter believe regions or not, normally they would believe people will end up in some spirit world after death. 



The idea is that the destruction of your body need not be the destruction of you because you are not your body

##### Why modern psychologists and neuroscientists so confident that dualism is wrong?

One is that it simply doesn't help us explain certain things that need to be explained. 

i.e how do we learn language? 

What do we find sexually attractive? 

How does memory work? 



The second concern is that, unlike the  Descartes’s time, we have a much better understanding what physical things can do which makes it 

entirely possible for many of us that we are set things. 

Nowadays, It just is so evident in everyday life that if physical events that affect the brain can affect ourselves, suggesting that at the very least, our mental life is intimately connected to the brain. 



 

I think materialism however uncomfortable, 

however unpalatable is a view that the science forces us to adopt. 



### Neurons

what is the physical seed of thought? 

What is the source of our emotions, 

or decision-making, our passions, 

or pains, and everything else? 

It is the brain.

Here's a diagram that depicts a typical neuron. So, what you see is the dendrites, and dendrites receive signals from other neurons. Either excitatory, like pluses, or inhibitory, minuses. Then they get to the cell body, which sums up these pluses and minuses. When you reach a certain threshold, a certain amount of pluses, there's neural firing.



Firing takes place through the axon,

So, what neurons do, is they sum up and transmit information,

 

By some estimates, it's 100 billion, 

or the estimates tend to be very different and very rough, 

but there's billions upon billions of neurons, 

and each connect to thousands, 

maybe tens of thousands of other neurons. 



So, neurons come in three flavors. 

There are sensory neurons, 

which take in information from the environment, 

from the external world. 

There's motor neurons, which go from the brain out to your motor control. 

So, if you touch something hot, 

and you feel the pain, 

that is sensory neurons, 

if you rent your hand back, 

or you reach for something, that's motor neurons. 

Finally, there's interneurons, which 

connect different neurons without making contact with external world. 



Since the neuron is dimorphic, how can we sense the environment such continuous?

The answer is: one way is in terms of the number of neurons that fire. Another factor is the impulse frequency of individual neurons.
