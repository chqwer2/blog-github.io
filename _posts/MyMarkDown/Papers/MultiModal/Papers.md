# **Thinking**

1. *source separation*: Extract specific sound out of noisy background
2. track the object
3. seg the object instance
4. 





### *Audio-Visual Objects from Video*

transform a video into a set of discrete audio-visual objects using self-supervised learning.

*To this end, we introduce a model that uses attention to localize and group sound sources,*

*and optical ow to aggregate information over time.*



*while [**26**] use spatial information*

*in a scene to convert mono sound to stereo.*



SSL:

*We represent* *an audio-visual object as the trajectory of a potential sound source through*

*space and time*



*picks out the regions of a video whose motions have a high degree*

*of synchronization with the audio.*
