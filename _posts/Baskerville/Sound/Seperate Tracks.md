## A better way to break up a sound wave

Music Source Separation in the Waveform Domain - Alexandre 





Demucs is a state-of-the-art music source separation mode

currently capable of separating drums, bass, and vocals from the rest of the accompaniment.





largely by adjusting the relative volume of the channels to simulate IID cues.
