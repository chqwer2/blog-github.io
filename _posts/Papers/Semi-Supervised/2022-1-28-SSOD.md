## Semi-Supervised Object Detection，SSOD

Same as Match-Series, also based on:

   **1. Consistensy Learning**

   **2. Pseudo-labeling**

And a background elimination method for avoiding loss of background dominate the loss.

Strong augmentation training new Model with pseudo label gained from Teacher Model.

 Strong augmentation including Geometric Transformation (Flip, shift, shear), box-level transformation (Cut, shift,rotation), Color Jittering.
